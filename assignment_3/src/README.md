# Cat-Dog Classifier Project

This project is a PyTorch Lightning-based image classification model for identifying dog breeds using the Kaggle dataset. It utilizes Docker to provide an isolated environment for training, evaluation, and inference.

## Features

- **Training**: Train the Cat-Dog Classifier model using the Kaggle dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Load a saved model checkpoint and evaluate it on the validation dataset.
- **Inference**: Run inference on 10 sample images to predict their breeds.
- **Docker**: The entire project runs in a Docker container for easy setup and reproducibility.

## Dataset

We are using the **Dog Breed Image Dataset** from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikhushikhushi/dog-breed-image-dataset).
